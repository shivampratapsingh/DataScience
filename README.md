# Predict Churn for a Telecom Company
Machine Learning Project in R.
Predict the customer churn of telecom sector and find out the key drivers that lead to churn.

# Description
Customer churn refers to a decision made by the customer about ending the business relationship. It is also referred to the loss of clients or customers.
Customer loyalty and customer churn always add up to 100%. If a firm has a 60% loyalty rate, then their loss or churn rate of customers is 40%. As per 80/20 customer profitability rule, 20% of customers are generating 80% of revenue.
So, it is very important to predict the users likely to churn from the business relationship and the factors affecting the customer decisions.
Here I am going to show how logistic regression model using R can be used to identify the customer churn in the telecom dataset.
